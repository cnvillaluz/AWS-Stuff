## **STEP 8: Test It Out!**

Now let's test if it works:

### **Option A: Test with an Issue**

1. In your GitHub repository, click **"Issues"** at the top
2. Click **"New issue"**
3. Give it a title like: `Test: Create a Hello World app`
4. In the description, write: `Create a simple Python script that prints "Hello World"`
5. Click **"Submit new issue"**
6. In the comment box, type: `@claude create a hello world app`
7. Press **"Comment"**

Claude should automatically respond and create code!

### **Option B: Test with a Pull Request**

1. Create a new branch in your repo (don't worry if you don't know how - GitHub can guide you)
2. Create a pull request
3. Comment: `@claude review this`
4. Claude will review your code!

## **What Happens Next (The Magic Part)**

Once everything is set up:

- **When you tag @claude in comments**, Claude reads what you asked
- **Claude makes code changes** and pushes them to your repo
- **Claude creates pull requests** for you to review
- **Claude reviews other people's code** automatically
- **Everything works 24/7** without you doing anything!
