2. [Learning Path](#learning-path)
3. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
4. [Repository Structure](#repository-structure)

## Getting Started

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This guide focuses on AWS as the primary cloud provider, but the concepts apply to any cloud platform.

### What You'll Learn

- **Basics**: Terraform fundamentals, HCL syntax, providers, and resources
- **Intermediate**: Variables, outputs, modules, state management, and data sources
- **Advanced**: Workspaces, dynamic blocks, complex expressions, CI/CD integration
- **Real-world Use Cases**: Production-ready patterns and best practices
- **Hands-on Labs**: Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account**: Free tier is sufficient for most examples
2. **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with credentials
3. **Terraform**: Install the latest version from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
4. **Basic Knowledge**:
   - Command line basics
   - Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
   - Familiarity with AWS services (helpful but not required)

### Installation Quick Start

```bash
# Verify AWS CLI installation
aws --version

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Verify Terraform installation
terraform version
```

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Week 1-2)
Start here if you're new to Terraform or Infrastructure as Code.

- [01 - Terraform Basics](./01-basics/README.md)
  - What is Terraform and IaC?
  - Installing and setting up Terraform
  - HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax
  - Providers and resources
  - Basic AWS resource creation (EC2, S3, VPC)
  - Terraform workflow: init, plan, apply, destroy

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts (Week 3-4)
Build on fundamentals with more complex configurations.

- [02 - Intermediate Concepts](./02-intermediate/README.md)
  - Variables and input validation
  - Outputs and data sources
  - Creating and using modules
  - State management and remote backends
  - Resource dependencies and lifecycle rules
  - Building a multi-tier AWS architecture

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Week 5-6)
Master advanced Terraform features for production use.

- [03 - Advanced Concepts](./03-advanced/README.md)
  - Dynamic blocks and complex expressions
  - Count and for_each meta-arguments
  - Terraform workspaces
  - Provider configuration and multiple regions
  - Terraform functions and conditionals
  - Import existing infrastructure
  - Security best practices

### Phase 4: Real-world Applications (Week 7-8)
Apply your knowledge to production scenarios.

- [04 - Use Cases & Patterns](./04-use-cases/README.md)
  - Multi-environment deployments
  - High-availability architectures
  - Disaster recovery patterns
  - Security and compliance
  - Cost optimization strategies
  - CI/CD integration with Terraform
  - Terraform Cloud and Enterprise

### Phase 5: Hands-on Practice (Ongoing)
Reinforce learning with practical exercises.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Sequential Learning**: Follow the chapters in order if you're new to Terraform
2. **Jump to Topics**: If you have experience, jump to specific topics of interest
3. **Hands-on Practice**: Type out examples instead of copy-pasting to build muscle memory
4. **Experiment**: Modify examples and see what happens
5. **Clean Up**: Always run `terraform destroy` after labs to avoid AWS charges

## Cost Considerations

Most examples use AWS Free Tier eligible resources. However:

- Always check current AWS pricing
- Destroy resources after practice sessions
- Set up AWS billing alerts
- Use `terraform plan` to preview changes before applying

## Best Practices Highlighted Throughout

- Version control your Terraform code
- Use remote state with locking
- Implement proper secret management
- Follow naming conventions
- Document your infrastructure
- Use modules for reusability
- Implement proper tagging strategies
