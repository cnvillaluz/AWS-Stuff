## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Your Own Lessons

Edit `assets/js/lessons.js` and add to the `lessonsData` object:

```javascript
{
    id: 'your-lesson-id',
    title: 'Your Lesson Title',
    duration: '20 min',
    description: 'Brief description',
    topics: ['Topic1', 'Topic2'],
    content: `<h3>Your HTML content here</h3>`
}
```

### Changing Colors/Themes

Edit `assets/css/style.css` and modify CSS variables:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #5c4ee5;
    --secondary-color: #00d4aa;
    /* Add your colors */
}
```

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### AWS Costs

Most examples use **AWS Free Tier** eligible resources:

- **EC2 t2.micro**: 750 hours/month free
- **S3**: 5GB storage free
- **VPC**: Free
- **Data Transfer**: 1GB free

### Important Cost Tips

⚠️ **Always run `terraform destroy` after practice!**

- Set up AWS billing alerts
- Use Cost Explorer to monitor spending
- Destroy resources when not in use
- Most practice sessions cost $0 if cleaned up properly
