## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to install any packages?**
A: No! This app uses only Python's standard library. No pip install needed.

**Q: Can I skip lessons and go straight to challenges?**
A: Yes, but we recommend completing lessons first to understand the concepts.

**Q: Will my progress be saved?**
A: Yes! Your progress is automatically saved after each lesson and challenge.

**Q: Can multiple people use this on the same computer?**
A: The app stores one profile at a time. To use different profiles, you can rename or backup the `data/progress.json` file.

**Q: I'm stuck on a challenge. Can I get hints?**
A: Each challenge includes task descriptions and sometimes hints. Review the corresponding lesson for more help.

**Q: What if I make a syntax error in a challenge?**
